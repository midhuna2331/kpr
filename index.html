    <p>Snakes are fascinating reptiles known for their long, limbless bodies and ability to slither. They have a diverse range of species, some venomous and others harmless, found across various habitats globally. Many snakes are carnivores, relying on prey like rodents, birds, and even other snakes for sustenance. Their unique adaptations, like flexible jaws and specialized teeth, allow them to swallow prey larger than their head.</p>
